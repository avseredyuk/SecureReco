Recording incoming/outgoing calls under Android in a secure manner

## Why

For fun. And due to the fact that there is a lot of such software, but all of it stores the call records in a insecure way. 
In case of lost or stolen, the phone opens all the secrets & privacy stuff of the owner to the third persons. It's no good.

## How

Using cryptographic stuff like symmetric & asymmetric encryption.
